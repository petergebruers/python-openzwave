"""Storing all the module configurations. Here, the database is setup to use
SQLite, because it's a very convenient dev env database.
Most likely /config.py won't be a part of your repository and will be different
on your test and production servers.

 - _basedir is a trick for you to get the folder where the script runs
 - DEBUG indicates that it is a dev environment, you'll get the very helpful
 error page from flask when an error occurs.
 - SECRET_KEY will be used to sign cookies. Change it and all your users will
 have to login again.
 - ADMINS will be used if you need to email information to the site
 administrators.
 - SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and DATABASE_CONNECT_OPTIONS are SQLAlchemy
 connection options (hard to guess)
 - THREAD_PAGE my understanding was 2/core... might be wrong :)
 - CSRF_ENABLED and CSRF_SESSION_KEY are protecting against form post fraud
 - RECAPTCHA_* WTForms comes with a RecaptchaField ready to use... just need
 to go to recaptcha website and get your public and private key.
